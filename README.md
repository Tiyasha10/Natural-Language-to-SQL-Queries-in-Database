# Natural-Language-to-SQL-Queries-in-Database
The project "Translation of Natural Language Queries to SQL" simplifies database querying by converting natural language into SQL using NLP techniques like tokenization and POS tagging. This allows non-technical users to access data without SQL knowledge, enhancing database accessibility and improving the user experience for all.
