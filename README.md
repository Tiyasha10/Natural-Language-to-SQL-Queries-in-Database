# Natural-Language-to-SQL-Queries-in-Database
## Abstract: 

Project on developing an NL2SQL (Natural Language to SQL) system leveraging NLP (Natural Language Processing) to translate user-friendly natural language questions into structured SQL queries that can be executed against a database for an NLID (Natural Language Interface to Database) system. The system processes user queries, extracts relevant information, and generates structured SQL statements. The methodology includes tokenization, part-of-speech tagging, and syntactic parsing to accurately map natural language inputs to SQL queries. The key findings demonstrate the systemâ€™s ability to effectively translate a range of queries into SQL, improving accessibility and efficiency in database interactions. The implications of this work extend to simplifying database management for users with limited technical expertise and enhancing the overall user experience in querying databases.

## INTRODUCTION:

The project titled "Translation of Natural Language Queries to SQL Queries towards Building a Natural Language Interface to Database" focuses on bridging the gap between non-technical users and database management systems. Traditionally, retrieving data from databases requires knowledge of SQL, which can be a barrier for many users. By developing a Natural Language to SQL (NL2SQL) system, this project aims to translate user-friendly, natural language queries into SQL statements. Leveraging Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques such as tokenization, part-of-speech tagging, and syntactic parsing, the system enables more accessible, intuitive, and efficient database interactions. The goal is to simplify the database querying process and enhance the user experience, particularly for those with limited technical expertise.
